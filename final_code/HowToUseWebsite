1. Download the questionPose folder in this repo from this folder
2. Navigate to the questionPose folder in terminal
3. >> python
4. >> db.create_all()
5. >> exit()
6. Ensure the database chats.db was created properly. this is where chats will log
7. While connected to EEG network, in the terminal >> python main.py
8. The site will be live on your ip, port 5000
9. Once ensuring events from the discovery app are being sent, navigate to the site on the phone
10. Enter the subject code and navigate the subject to the beginning of the calibration tasks
11. The site will automatically bring the subject to the audio test after the contrast test. You can view their
progress in your terminal - the terminal will display when they get to the next task, and if there are any issues or
if the subject needs help
12. When the subject switches away from the oddball page, they will get to a "indexPageInstructions.html" template. At this 
point, enter and explain how to use the chatbot (ie type as much as possible, dont worry about errors, etc)
13. You can monitor the chatbot's progress from your terminal. You can see the question they are on, as well as how many
characters they have typed. Once they reach 4000 characters or run out of questions, reenter the room to finish the experiment

NOTES:
RESTART THE FLASK SERVER (cntrl c to spin down, python main.py to spin up) BETWEEN EACH SUBJECT as this will reset the 
environment variables
If the IP of the ESP changes, alter the ip address timestamps are sent to in the oddball and contrast html files
